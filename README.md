# 🧢 Zuno — UNF Student Marketplace

https://zuno-iota.vercel.app/

Zuno is a full-stack web application built specifically for students at the University of North Florida (UNF). It serves as a secure and fun online marketplace where verified students can buy, sell, and chat about goods and services directly within their university community.

## 🎯 Purpose

Zuno was created to provide a localized, student-only alternative to platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp — without the spam or strangers. By requiring a UNF email for sign-up, Zuno ensures a trusted environment where students can safely transact.
